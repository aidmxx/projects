# projects
This repository aims to store all school projects that created by the author `aidmxx` up to now. Considering the various of projects' main language, therefore, the projects are categorised via their edited programme lanugages. The format is following by `programme lanugage/course_laugage/project/etc`.
And below is shown the specific project categorisation and its content introduction:
## Python language
### INFO1110 Introduction to Programming
#### Assignment 1
This project could be found in directory ([projects/python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1](projects/python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1)).  
This project aims to create a text-based version of Mousehunt game. In this game, the Kingdom is overrun by mice. And user acts as a hunter to eradicate mice to gain gold and cheese （serve as a decoy to hunt mice）after successfully. As the beginning of programming, this task has been separated into seven tasks.

- Task 1: Display title, logo and credits [related to `q1.py`]
- Task 2: Store vaild name [related to `q2.py`]
- Task 3: Function to check vaild name [related to `name.py`]
- Task 4: Training on how to hunt a mouse [related to `q4.py`]
- Task 5: Training again untill be stopped [related to `train.py`]
- Task 6: The Cheese Shop to check/purchase cheese [related to `shop.py`]
- Task 7: Combine the whole project [related to `game.py`]

#### Assignment 2
This project could be found in directory (projects/python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2).
This project is an extension game of Assignment 1. In comparison to Assignment 1, this project extends all the structures it covers.
- Task 1: Upgrade Cheese Shop with three types [related to `shop.py`]
- Task 2: Skip structure & identification on each cheese [related to `train.py` and `game.py`]
- Task 3: New mouse type release [related to `mouse.py`]
- Task 4: Self testing on new cheese&mouse [related to `test.py` and `test_plan.md`]
- Task 5: Check profanity on username [related to `name.py`]
- Task 6: Check game setup correctly [related to `setup.py`]
- Task 7: Combine the improved full project with three traps [related to `game_final.py`]
- Task 8: Format structures as each classes [related to `game_oo.py`, `trap.py`, `hunter.py`, `cshop.py` and `interface.py`]
