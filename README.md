# projects
This repository aims to store all school projects that created by the author `aidmxx` up to now. Considering the various of projects' main language, therefore, the projects are categorised via their edited programme lanugages. The format is following by `programme lanugage/course_laugage/project/etc`.
And below is shown the specific project categorisation and its content introduction:
## Python language
### INFO1110 Introduction to Programming
#### Assignment 1
This project could be found in directory ([python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1)).  
This project aims to create a text-based version of Mousehunt game. In this game, the Kingdom is overrun by mice. And user acts as a hunter to eradicate mice to gain gold and cheese （serve as a decoy to hunt mice）after successfully. As the beginning of programming, this task has been separated into seven tasks.

- Task 1: Display title, logo and credits [related to [q1.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1/q1.py)]
- Task 2: Store vaild name [related to [q2.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1/q2.py)]
- Task 3: Function to check vaild name [related to [name.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1/name.py)]
- Task 4: Training on how to hunt a mouse [related to [q4.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1/q4.py)]
- Task 5: Training again untill be stopped [related to [train.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1/train.py)]
- Task 6: The Cheese Shop to check/purchase cheese [related to [shop.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1/shop.py)]
- Task 7: Combine the whole project [related to [game.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-1/game.py)]

#### Assignment 2
This project could be found in directory ([python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2)).
This project is an extension game of Assignment 1. In comparison to Assignment 1, this project extends all the structures it covers.
- Task 1: Upgrade Cheese Shop with three types [related to [shop.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/shop.py)]
- Task 2: Skip structure & identification on each cheese [related to [train.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/train.py) and [game.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/game.py)]
- Task 3: New mouse type release [related to [mouse.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/mouse.py)]
- Task 4: Self testing on new cheese&mouse [related to [test.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/test.py) and [test_plan.md](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/test_plan.md)]
- Task 5: Check profanity on username [related to [name.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/name.py)]
- Task 6: Check game setup correctly [related to [setup.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/setup.py)]
- Task 7: Combine the improved full project with three traps [related to [game_final.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/game_final.py)]
- Task 8: Format structures as each classes [related to [game_oo.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/game_oo.py), [trap.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/trap.py), [hunter.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/hunter.py), [cshop.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/cshop.py) and [interface.py](python/INFO1110/info1110-asm-2/interface.py)]

## Java language
### INFO1113 Object-Oriented Programming
#### WizardTower
This project could be found in directory ([java/INFO1113/WizardTower](java/INFO1113/WizardTower)).
This project aims to create a Java language based Wizard Tower game. The player is able to place and update tower on the map to prevent enemies from reaching the wizard's tower. And the specific task description could be found in [here](java/INFO1113/WizardTower/INFO1113_Assignment_2023_S2.pdf). However, the project has only be built up to the enemy movement to find the direct road automatically and failed to build the structure of towers.
